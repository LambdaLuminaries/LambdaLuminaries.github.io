{"name":"Lambda Luminaries","tagline":"Functional Programming User Group","body":"### Welcome to Lambda Luminaries.\r\n\r\nWe are a bunch of [Functional Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) enthusiasts in and around Gauteng.\r\n\r\nWe [meet in Centurion](http://www.meetup.com/lambda-luminaries/), and our members are typically based in Pretoria and Johannesburg.\r\n\r\nWe started this group in August 2011 on Google Groups. Our first physical meetup was held on Monday, September 12, 2011.\r\n\r\nWe get together once a month (every second Monday of the month) to discuss functional programming concepts and languages e.g. Haskell, Clojure, Scala, Erlang etc. We also like comparing these to other languages.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to:\r\n\r\n - help foster and grow a healthy FP community.\r\n - build skills by learning from each other.\r\n - have some interesting conversations with like-minded people.\r\n - keep the fun in functional programming.","google":"UA-49310652-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
